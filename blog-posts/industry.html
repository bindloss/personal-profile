	<h2 class="large-blog-heading">I hear there is a talent shortage?</h2>

	<p>Here's an interesting fact from the recently updated <a href="https://technation.techcityuk.com/" title="Tech Nation report">Tech Nation</a> report: <em>"The digital tech industry in the UK turns over more than Â£170bn a year". </em> </p>

	<p><strong>Okay... where do I sign up?</strong>
	</p>

	<h3 class="blog-headings">Now i'm excited</h3>

	<p>After finishing reading through the <a href ="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/sites/default/files/Skills%20Audit%20Report%202017.pdf" title="Manchester Digital Skills audit report">Manchester Digital Skills Audit</a> and the <a href="https://technation.techcityuk.com/" title="Tech nation report">Tech Nation</a> reports, I learned that the digital industry is growing extremely fast, especially within the UK. It states that the average digital salary in the UK during 2016 was 44% higher than the average non-digital salary. See (figure 1) below.</p>

	<figure>

	</figure>

	<p>Researching into the industry has made me realise that I am in a pretty good spot to capitalize on the talent shortage and broaden my connections with potential employers.</p>

	<h3 class="blog-headings">How have I networked?</h3>

	<p>Throughout my time at university, I have taken advantage of meetups/conferences such as <a href="deliverconf.co.uk" title="Deliver conference website">Deliver Conference</a>, <a href="https://nuxuk.org/" title="NUX website">NUX</a> and multiple CSS workshops.</p>

	<p>I have learned so much from these opportunities, whether it's project management, UX or front-end development. I have also gained a greater insight into what the industry is like to work in and the people I have met along the way have been great to speak to and learn from.</p>

	<p>There is an interesting article on <a href ="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/web-designers-guide-to-professional-networking/" title="Smashing magazine article">Smashing Magazine</a>, written by Steven Snell which states the importance of why you should network, even if you do already have a job. Steven says that <em>"if more people know about you and your services, then you'll have more opportunities for referrals".</em> 

	<p>Now, referring back to the <a href ="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/sites/default/files/Skills%20Audit%20Report%202017.pdf" title="Manchester Digital Skills audit report">Manchester Digital Skills Audit</a> report, an infographic (See figure 2 below) shows that the most effective method for recruiting new talent is through internal recommendation and peer recommendation. So, in that case, I think it's safe to say I'll be doing everything I can to attend as many  free meetups in the coming years as I can.</p>

	<p>I have also been lucky enough to meet senior UX analysts at <a href="https://www.amaze.com/" title="Amaze website">Amaze</a>, a digital agency based in Manchester. I had the opportunity to look around their offices, listen to an hour-long presentation on what workflows they undertake in order to have achieved their outstanding array of case studies and also asked questions on what it's like working in the industry.</p>

	<h3 class="blog-headings">Does my skillset offer anything to the table?</h3>

	<p>The most sought-after role in the industry right now is the role of being a developer. Another factor that benefits my skillset is that the most used programming languages are JavaScript and PHP. <a href="/portfolio.html#programming-link" title="Link to my web programming applications">Why not check out the JavaScript applications I made?</a> Although I am certainly not at an advanced level with both of these programming languages yet, it is helpful to know that I already have the basics down and have the willingness to learn further.</p>

	<p>I have also had 4 years experience in retail (shocking, I know). Initially, I always thought that having this kind of experience wouldn't be beneficial in future life. But, I was wrong. Over these years I have been entrusted with managing members of staff throughout the day, responsible for closing and opening workplaces, dealt with cash and figures and also become so, so much better with speaking to people.</p>

	<p>Over these years I have seen my confidence increase massively and my interpersonal skills have improved because of this. I believe these skills will certainly help within the digital workplace with aspects such as sharing ideas, willingness to receive critical feedback and also dealing with clients.</p>

	<h3 class="blog-headings">Summary</h3>

	<p>Personally, I feel lucky to have got into the industry at this particular time, considering how fast it is growing. After researching into the digital industry, I now have a much better understanding of what is required of me to excel and develop my own skills. Whether it's improving on my JavaScript, learning new languages or even networking more. I feel like by the end of my final year at University, I will be fully geared up, ready for the life ahead of me and, most importantly, <strong>Agency Ready.</strong></p>
