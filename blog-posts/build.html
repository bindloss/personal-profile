		<h2 class="large-blog-heading">Right, where do I start?</h2>

		<p>I knew from the start that I needed to create a website that stands out to potential employers. I read <a href="http://blog.building-blocks.com/insights/the-importance-of-a-homepage-first-impressions" title="Article on importance of first impressions">Kyle Cassidy's blog post </a>on the importance of homepage design and he spoke about the "Halo effect". <em>"The halo effect is a psychological phenomenon where a potential employer is more likely to be impressed by the candidate based solely on the initial impression."</em> For this reason, I wanted to create the best first impression possible and show off my skills. So... </p>

		<h3 class="blog-headings">Chanelling the Halo effect</h3>

		<p>Welcome to the joy of the powers of CSS3 and the use of the "background-image: (url)" property. I had an idea in my head of a photo I wanted to take for the homepage, so I used a Canon 550d, DSLR with nice lighting and then got to work with photoshop. Firstly, changing the levels of the photo and cropping down to a suitable size. Then applied a sketch filter and there you have it (see figure 1).</p>

		<figure>

			<figcaption class="image-caption">
				<em>Figure 1</em>
				<br> Example of the process of making my banner image
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>So, great news, I was happy with how the edit had turned out, but even still I felt like there was work to be done. This is where I applied the background-blend technique to my CSS. I applied the "multiply" effect before finally coming to a final decision on which colour was most suitable (dark blue).</p>

		<p>From this moment onwards, I had an idea about the colour palette for my whole site, and then kept these colours consistent throughout my site in order to generate a recognisable, clean house style from start to finish.</p>

		<p>I knew this was important after reading <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/janet-odgis/keeping-color-consistent-_b_8749334.html" title="Article from Huffington post about keeping colour consistent">Janet Odgis's post</a> on the well established website Huffington Post on keeping colour consistent as she says <em>"Colour is a way to differentiate yourself in a crowded marketplace".</em> </p>

		<p>After all, the amount of competition for jobs these days is challenging enough as it is. Therefore, standing out from the crowd and using bright, vibrant colours and a recognisable colour palette will enable users to easily identify my site compared to others.</p>

		<h3 class="blog-headings">Research</h3>

		<p>Considering this was my own personal site, the research phase was much less challenging than other projects I have worked on. I had the freedom to go in any direction I wanted in terms of design and build.</p>

		<p>In order to get my brain working, I searched for some inspiration and found a few brilliant sites which I found really suited me and my style. I compiled my findings into a mood board (See figure 2 below). You'll notice that a few design features of these sites have had an impact on my own design.</p>

		</figure>

		<h3 class="blog-headings">Design</h3>

		<p>After I had completed researching, I moved to designing my site before even touching my laptop. I did this by sketching out multiple wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop. Simply providing a basis for ideas and different designs can help greatly when laying out the HTML structure of the site. </p>

		<p>I referred back to the colour palette I picked up on in my mood board (figure 2) but after trying out the colours, I realised they needed slightly tweaking for accessibility reasons. I was able to check whether certain colours were hard to see thanks to the use of a google chrome extension, Accessibility Developer Tools which would provide a rating on whether certain colours of text were too hard to read. </p>

		<h3 class="blog-headings">Build</h3>

		<p>When I started to get coding, I firstly provided a solid HTML5 structure before getting to work on the CSS or scripting. When all of my pages had a semantic structure in place I started to move on to the CSS. </p>

		<p>The biggest challenges I face when coming to the build of any site is the positioning of elements, and flex-box can be such a pain sometimes! Thankfully, after a hard-fought battle with media queries and responsiveness, I got there in the end. </p>

		<p>It wasn't over until I ran the site through an HTML validator and made sure my code was clean and concise while making sure shorthand CSS was used where possible in order to increase web-page performance.</p>
