					<p>The aim of this project was to build a multi-platform website to
					reflect what life is like as an Information &amp; Communications student
					at Manchester Metropolitan University.</p>
					<p>The site's objectives were to be informative to potential future
					students within the Information &amp; Communications department as well as
					providing a professional platform that will help inform its users, show a
					rounded depiction of life as a student in Manchester and also present a
					positive view of the students and their associated course.</p>
					<p>Although looking back on the overall design of the website, it
					certainly isn't the most visually pleasing but it does offer extremely
					effortless navigation throughout with plenty of well-written content and
					useful information within all aspects of the site.</p>

					<p>Street food is an international phenomenon, which over recent years has
					taken the country by storm. The industry has enabled many people to start
					their own businesses and find success without the risk of big upfront
					investments.</p>
					<p>Me and my group explored the journey of chef Richard Brown and how he
					begun as a small time street food trader to now recently opening up a
					brand new restaurant in the luxurious area of Spinningfields,
					Manchester.</p>
					<p>This individual webisode of the series examined what risks Richard has
					faced throughout his career to get to where he is now.</p>

					<p>Darius has recently started to make his own music, so for professional
					reasons he wanted a website to help advertise his music and soon to be his
					own original youtube videos.</p>
					<p>The site is not fully completed and is not live yet, but he is still
					working on providing me with more content and also videos for his
					youtube.</p>

			<h2 id="programming-link">Web Programming</h2>
			<p>Considering that JavaScript is the most in-demand programming language
			right now, these applications are a good way to demonstrate my understanding
			of the language.</p>
			<p>These applications include different elements such as
			encryption/decryption, an order form and an example of a pub menu which
			incorporates AJAX and JSON.</p>

						<h3><a class="prog-headings" href=
						"external-websites/web-programming/customerform.html">Order Form</a></h3>
						<p>The customer order form demonstrates an understanding of calculations
						through JavaScript and uses different form elements to influence the
						final price of the completed form.</p>
						<p>Once the form has been filled out by the user, a message at the bottom
						of the page would appear with all the final deductions/additions.</p>

						<h3><a class="prog-headings" href=
						"external-websites/web-programming/encryptor.html">Encryptor</a></h3>
						<p>This application would take any message from the user and encrypt it
						into a new combination of letters, dependent on their key.</p>
						<p>The user then has the option to copy and paste the encrypted message
						provided and input into a decryptor. When run, the initial user input
						would be returned.</p>

					<div class="prog-spacing">
						<h3><a class="prog-headings" href=
						"external-websites/web-programming/pub-menu/menu.html">Pub Menu</a></h3>
						<p>This pub menu demonstrates the use of AJAX and JSON. Features include
						an externally stored JSON file which is used to change the pub menu
						depending on which day the user chooses.</p>
						<p>It also features a picture carousel towards the bottom right of the
						page which changes photo every 4 seconds to add a bit more life to the
						site.</p>
						<p>Time constraints meant that the search filter was not able to be
						completed in time.</p>
