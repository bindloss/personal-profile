			<h4 class="project-details-title">Project Details</h4>

			<p class="p-spacing">This unit was a challenging student-led project to develop the understanding, skills and experience in running with Digital Management projects. It focused more on the behind the scenes rather than the final deliverable (website) itself.</p>

			<p class="p-spacing">As the joint project manager to this unit, I got an insight into what it is like leading a group and understanding the pressure of reaching organised and precise short term goals before reaching the final end product.</p>

			<p class="p-spacing">With the only support from the lecturers coming from the designated client meetings, this unit relied entirely on the work ethic and contribution of the whole team.</p>

			<p class="center-text">Overall grade: 74%

		<h4 class="project-details-title">Project Details</h4>
		
		<p class="p-spacing">The aim of this project was to build a multi-platform website to reflect what life is like as an Information &amp; Communications student at Manchester Metropolitan University.</p>

		<p class="p-spacing">The site's objectives were to be informative to potential future students within the Information &amp; Communications department as well as providing a professional platform that will help inform its users, show a rounded depiction of life as a student in Manchester and also present a positive view of the students and their associated course.</p>
		
		<p class="p-spacing">Although looking back on the overall design of the website, it certainly isn't the most visually pleasing but it does offer extremely effortless navigation throughout with plenty of well-written content and useful information within all aspects of the site.</p>
		
		<p class="center-text">Overall grade: 69%</p>

			<h4 class="project-details-title">Project Details</h4>
		
			<p class="p-spacing">Street food is an international phenomenon, which over recent years has taken the country by storm. The industry has enabled many people to start their own businesses and find success without the risk of big upfront investments.</p>

			<p class="p-spacing">Me and my group explored the journey of chef Richard Brown and how he begun as a small time street food trader to now recently opening up a brand new restaurant in the luxurious area of Spinningfields, Manchester.</p>

			<p class="p-spacing">This individual webisode of the series examined what risks Richard has faced throughout his career to get to where he is now.</p>

			<p class="p-spacing">Darius had asked me to make him a quick website at the beginning of my third year. He provided me with a few high-quality images and let me get to work on providing a platform for himself on the web.</p>

			<p class="p-spacing">Darius has recently started to make his own music, so for professional reasons he wanted a website to help advertise his music and soon to be his own original youtube videos.</p>

			<p class="p-spacing">The site is not fully completed and is not live yet, but he is still working on providing me with more content and also videos for his youtube.</p>

		<h2 id="programming-link">Web Programming</h2>
		
		<div class="prog-position">
			<p class="p-spacing">These applications were built during my second year and I have taken what I have learned from them and implemented them into my own work as much as I can. Considering that JavaScript is the most in-demand programming language right now, these applications are a good way to demonstrate my understanding of the language. These applications include different elements such as encryption/decryption, an order form and an example of a pub menu which incorporates AJAX and JSON.</p>
			
			<p class="p-spacing"><strong>Why not try them out for yourself?</strong></p>

			<h3>Order Form</h3>
				
				<a href="external-websites/web-programming/customerform.html" class="prog-button" title="Customer order form application">Try it out</a>	
				<p class="p-spacing">The customer order form demonstrates an understanding of calculations through JavaScript and uses different form elements to influence the final price of the completed form.</p>

				<p class="p-spacing">Once the form has been filled out by the user, a message at the bottom of the page would appear with all the final deductions/additions. </p> 

				<p><strong>Overall grade: 78%</strong></p>

				<h3>Encryptor</h3>

				<a href="external-websites/web-programming/encryptor.html" class="prog-button" title="Encryptor application">Try it out</a>

				<p class="p-spacing">This application would take any message from the user and encrypt it into a new combination of letters, dependent on their key.</p>

				<p class="p-spacing">
				The user then has the option to copy and paste the encrypted message provided and input into a decryptor. When run, the initial user input would be returned.</p>

				<p class="p-spacing"><strong>Overall grade: 85%</strong></p>

			<div class="prog-spacing">
	
				<h3>Pub menu</h3>

				<a href="external-websites/web-programming/pub-menu/menu.html" class="prog-button">Try it out</a>

				<p class="p-spacing">This pub menu demonstrates the use of AJAX and JSON. Features include an externally stored JSON file which is used to change the pub menu depending on which day the user chooses.</p>

				<p class="p-spacing">It also features a picture carousel towards the bottom right of the page which changes photo every 4 seconds to add a bit more life to the site.</p>

				<p class="p-spacing">Time constraints meant that the search filter was not able to be completed in time.</p>
