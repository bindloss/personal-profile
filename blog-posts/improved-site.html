		<h2 class="secondary-blog-heading">Blog post</h2>
		
		<h3 class="date">Please note: this blog post was written in 2017 so some information may be outdated.</h3>

		<h3 class="blog-headings">Aim</h3>

		<p>To improve my personal profile to a higher, professional standard.</p>

		<h3 class="blog-headings">Objectives</h3>

		<ul class="blog-list">
			<li>Analyse the positives and negatives of the first draft of my personal profile.</li>
			<li>To apply changes and improvements where necessary.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="blog-headings">We all have to start somewhere...</h3>
				
		<p>It's not all doom and gloom though as the first draft of my personal profile did offer great accessibility, functionality and was considerably easy to navigate from place to place. These positives were not forgotten about and were carried into all versions of my profile. These "behind the scenes" aspects within any website are essential, as most of the time, the design isn't the most important thing, it's actually making sure the site can be accessed and be fully functional.</p>
		<p> There's nothing worse than going on a site that has dead links or doesn't consider accessibility as "web accessibility is about building websites so that there are as few barriers to use as possible for anyone, regardless of ability and the device used to access the information” (Robbins, 2006:56).</p>
		
		<h3 class="blog-headings">We need to talk about the side-facing portrait...</h3>
		
		<figure>

			<figcaption class="image-caption">
				Figure 1
				<br>
				What was I thinking?
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>The reason why the younger version of Sam decided to come up with this strange idea was because of the poor readability of the "About me" text. I knew this was an issue that needed to be solved after I read Robyn Collinge's blog post on improving readability; “if you make your lines much longer, you might scare your visitors off” <a href="http://blog.usabilla.com/8-guidelines-for-better-readability-on-the-web/">(Collinge, 2017:online).</a></p>
		
		<p>By adding my ridiculously photoshopped face on the side of the screen I felt like it would push the text more to the left, and become easier to read. In order to avoid having to use a seflie again, a general rule of thumb I stick to now is to never center align large chunks of text and to try my best to never force the user to read sentences that take up more than 50-60% of the screen. </p>
		
		<p>For this reason, I introduced a carousel (JavaScript) on my homepage in order to split up the content into 3 different sections (Figure 2).</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="images/carousel.png" alt="New version of a HTML carousel Sam implemented onto his homepage">
			
			<figcaption class="image-caption">
				Figure 2
				<br>
				Newly implemented HTML and JavaScript carousel for my "about me" section
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h3 class="blog-headings">Second attempt</h3>
		
		<p>With the second draft, you will see many similarities with my current one. It still keeps the same functionality and accessibility as the first draft, but this time the page layout has improved significantly (not sure about that colour scheme though). Simple things like improving the buttons (Figure 3), the footer (Figure 4) and fonts were changed after analysing this version.</p>
		
		<figure>

			<figcaption class="image-caption">

				Improvements from the previous buttons and current buttons (these ones aren't clickable!)

		<div class="rectangle"></div>

			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h3 class="blog-headings">Evaluation</h3>
		
		<p>Overall, I personally feel that my coding ability has greatly improved. My knowledge with HTML, CSS and JavaScript is at the best level it's ever been at and I now feel confident in making a static website for any client <a href="../index.html#mg-services">(see my practical web project for MG Property Services)</a>.</p>
		<p>On top of this, I have <a href="../blog-posts/grid.html">self-taught myself how CSS Grid works</a> and will continue to improve my knowledge on all things web related for the foreseeable future.</p>

		<p>It's most likely I'll eventually look back on this version of my website and be just as embarrassed as I have been with the previous two as I would have learned so much more. Finally, I'm aware that I'll need to constantly "keep up with new technologies and trends within this industry as the web platform evolves, build processes will adjust and best practices will evolve with it, like they always have" <a href="https://css-tricks.com/future-front-end-web-development/">(Coyier, 2017:online)</a>.</p>
