<!-- 			COURSE ESSENTIALS 			-->
			
			

			<div id="courseEssentials" class="tabcontent">

<h2>Course Essentials</h2>

<p>If you are looking to study or are currently studying within the Information &amp; Communications department then there are various different bits of equipment which are essential to succeed on the course. Certain bits of equipment are more important than others purely due to the nature of the course itself.</p>

<ol>
<li>Laptop/PC/Mac</li>
<li>Mobile phone</li>
<li>USB stick</li>
<li>Pencil case (all the usual things from school - pens, pencils, ruler, rubber etc.)</li>
<li>Notebook - A4 lined paper</li>
</ol>

<img class="img-position" src="Images/course-essentials1.jpg" alt="Equipment necessary for Students">

<h3>1) Laptop/PC/Mac</h3>

<p>Seeing as though you are looking at a degree related to ICT. A Laptop/PC/Mac is extremely beneficial to any course you take within the information &amp; Communications department, although not entierly essential. Much of the coursework will be needed to be done on a computer and so almost every aspect of work will be based around computers and the idea of them. The majority of your work would be conducted and saved on these devices if you own one, this can then help keep you and your work organised. As well as this, some lectures will require you to work on devices during the lecture. Laptops will be provided if you don't own one but will surely help you feel more comfortable with your work if you do own one. </p>

<h3>2) Mobile phone</h3>

<p>Pretty self explanatory really... you're going to need one to keep in contact with friends you make along the way. As well as answering frequent phone calls from your worried Mum during freshers week.<br><br>
On top of this, smart phones are also extremely great in keeping up to date with your University emails, checking your timetable and the camera on some of them can even be so good you can use them for your coursework.
</p>

<h3>3) USB stick</h3>

<p>You will probably leave it in the back of one of the University computers the majority of the time but they're handy little pieces of equipment. It is advisable to have one with a larger amount of storage space due to large amounts of work. It will save you many hours of stressing over lost work if any problems occur with your computer and could ultimately be a life saver if any of your work accidentally gets wiped.
</p>

<img class="img-position" src="Images/courseEssentials2.jpg" alt="Equipment necessary for Students including Macbook, notebook, pens and pencils">

<h3>4) Pencil case</h3>

<p>Although you may think a pencil case and its equipment isn’t too necessary, it will be needed more than you’d think. If you decide to take up the Website Development module then you’ll need this equipment to help with creating designs for your projects. All of this will also be needed during lectures as writing down notes is essential for keeping up to date with your work.</p>

<h3>5) Notebook</h3>

<p>This goes hand in hand with the pencil case and all of its equipment. You will need this to contain all of your notes and drawn up designs. However, it may not be seen as too important as many students decide to use their laptops/tablets to type up their lecture notes. Regardless, a few of these are still absolutely essential, you never know when you’re going to need to write some useful information down.</p>

<!-- 				MRL 				-->

<h2>Multimedia Resource Labaratory (MRL)</h2>

<p>The Multimedia Resource Labaratory (commonly known as the <strong>MRL</strong>) is the main hub for the Information &amp; Communications students. This is where you will be spending most of your time during your stay at the University. Lectures, workshops and seminars will mostly be held here. It's home to all of the Information &amp; Communications students. The reason why is because the main hub contains big, shiny Apple macs as well as other seperate rooms filled with computers for classes, and if they're free your personal use. </p>

<p>Along with these suites there is also a small office which is managed by a technician. Within the office, there are many different cameras and equipment available to loan for a period between 24-72 hours depending on the equipment type. It contains audio equipment, DSLR cameras and handheld recorders for students to borrow to help with their studies. 
</p>

<p>There is also a large variety of magazines within the MRL that are available to read. The majority of these are related to the course and so it allows students to try and look up anything that they may be stuck with or that they may be interested in the read to either pass the time or learn something new.
</p>

<p>All of this makes the MRL a comfortable working environment with tutors and lecturers from the course often being there and so help is almost always at hand.
